My personal knowledge system goal: to stop curating a pile of meaningless notes and to stop creating more work for myself. I want to be thinking and doing, not wasting time.



### Topics I'm Exploring
[Genetic counseling skills](zk-lyt-pks/mocs/genetic-counseling-skills.md) 

[Genetic testing for hereditary cancer](zk-lyt-pks/mocs/genetic-testing-hereditary-cancer.md)

[Linking Your Thinking Workshop, 2020](zk-lyt-pks/mocs/LYT-course-moc-2020.md)

[What it means to be "open source"](zk-lyt-pks/mocs/open-source-mindset.md)

### Brainstorming
Not sure if I want to default format all my notes with frontmatter to save on adding it later if I do publish. For the moment leaning toward not bothering since I may never take that step. Can revisit this in future

Nov-01-2020 thinking about letting anything i'm okay sharing be in one big list in my root folder. everything in my inbox or other folders should be unpublished by default. might save on mess? i still dont love adding more structure and keeping notes in seperate buckets but thats easier than selecting files one-by-one to share
