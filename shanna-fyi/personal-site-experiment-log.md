# Experiment Log
Keeping track of questions and problems as I, a person with minimal recent experience in website building, try to build a website.

`‚ùì Can a personal website and a site for zettels live in different GitHub repositories?`

I was thinking the answer would be no but I wondered if having a repository folder inside my main site folder would help. I can certainly create links in obsidian between those folders. I'll try adding my previous experiment site ["Shanna's Slipbox"](https://shanna.fyi/Slipbox/). It currently shows up as a subsection of shanna.fyi.
- Testing link to another repo: "2020-08-28-test-post" This nearly worked. It did go to shannafyi/slipbox, but blog files are named differently on github.
- new test link to a stand alone page "new_format_rules"	
	- i think these links to .md files aren't being translated to .html?
- Checking links to other pages within the same repo and they are rendered just fine.

`üß™ Result: Maybe I can't easily link between to two repositories the way I can easily link between files in Obsidian. Or at least I don't know how to do this.`

`‚ùì Can a website for personal projects, professional info, and my LYT system coexist under one domain?`

- [Maxime V personal garden/blog combo](https://maximevaillancourt.com/) and [breakdown of his personal site vs garden template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template/issues/19)
- [Question in LYT forum](https://forum.linkingyourthinking.com/t/thoughts-on-online-notes-personal-website/157)

Nov-2020: New repository of all digital brain related files, which could include notes, cv, or other articles, and using .gitignore to skip drafts or anything not ready for display.

## Older Notes
Will add other scraps of experiment notes soon.

#### 2020-08-22
- Just exploring themes rather than really learning anything tonight. 
- Curious how to get logo working. Or literally any of the theme. Kind of just guessing here.
- Going to try the desktop option. Esp b/c GH says their desktop program doesn't use the command line and I have limited command line experience.
  - see d/l page: [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)
  - see directions page for getting familiar with program: [install instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop)
