# Digital Brain Lvl5 👩🏻
*<small>(AKA: learning to create a Home Note)</small>*

<ins>My personal knowledge system goal:</ins> to stop curating a pile of meaningless notes and to stop creating more work for myself. I want to be thinking and doing, not wasting time.
<br>


📌 Reminder for later, ideas for capstone project [from unit 1](zk-sgs/light%20bucket/202010302046-lyt-unit-1-materials.md#%5Ecapstone-idea)
<br>

### Maps of Content (MOCs)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; → [Markdown MOC](zk-public/-markdown.md) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; → [Zettelkasten MOC](zk-public/-zettelkasten.md)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; → [LYT Course Links](zk-public/-lyt-workshop-map.md)


<table class="moctable">
<tr>
<td>cell1_1 is here</td>
<td>cell2_1 hello</td>
<td>cell3_1</td>
<td>cell4_1</td>
</tr>
</table>



My first experiment with a map of content was while I learned how to use Markdown (and Obsidian). Thanks to [Nick-Milo](zk-public/-nick-milo.md) and the folks at [zettelkasten-de](zk-public/zettelkasten-de-website.md) for first introducing the idea of structure notes or maps for my digital notes.

### Topics I'm Exploring

- [Genetic testing for hereditary cancer](zk-lyt-pks/mocs/genetic-testing-hereditary-cancer.md)
- [Linking Your Thinking Workshop, 2020](zk-lyt-pks/mocs/LYT-course-moc-2020.md)

<br>

A few [action tags](-Action%20Tags.md) under review for usefulness

- #sgs-to-process 
- #sgs-to-develop 
- #sgs-to-review 
- #sgs-read-more-on-subject 
- #sgs-brainstorming 


<br>

### Brainstorming
Not sure if I want to default format all my notes with frontmatter to save on adding it later if I do publish. For the moment leaning toward not bothering since I may never take that step and/or I might have to edit it all again since I don't know much about this. Can revisit this in future
