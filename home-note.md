My knowledge system goal: I want to be thinking and doing, not wasting time. I want to stop curating a pile of meaningless notes and to stop creating more work for myself. [My reminders for limiting distractions](zk-public/tips-for-focusing-on-thinking)

LYT Unit 4: The Home Note
Start building in some more ideas and placeholders for the home note. Will grow with time. I pushed my current links down a bit.
