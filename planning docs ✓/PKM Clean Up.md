# ZK/PKM/Obsidian Folder Clean Up

## Goals
Would like to have ideas that are not just scrap notes and are better connected. 

## Current State
Have files in multiple different folders in "digital-brain" root folder that I use in Obsidian. I also have "-box" which is/was my inbox for bookmarks and quick notes. I'm okay keeping it for future use but it's an unusable mess right now that is overflowing with stuff.
