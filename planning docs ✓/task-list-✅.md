### Future Plans/Thoughts
- If I create a GTD folder or folder for other resources related to project/task management I might move this file out of the root folder.
- Think this is a useful tag for "someday" plans or rough ideas for a project/task. Concrete, 1 step tasks or projects can go into task manager
- Sep-22-2020: going to try also listing some quick thoughts in this note and pin it to the right sidebar like I thought of here [202009222028-notes-for-days-weeks-people](!nbox/202009222028-notes-for-days-weeks-people.md)
