# List of Active Projects





Review Nov-01-2020
- [x] [[ABGC Recertification 2020]]
- [x] [[GC License-Minnesota]]

Comments: Have A LOT of projects in Obsidian and Things3 to clean up and add plans. Would like T3 to be for next actions/deadlines since it'll be easier to see what's coming up there. 
❓ Would it be easier to have a Todoist iframe in Obsidian for this? Save it as a workspace?

thinking that i might not differtiate between active/inactive/someday states here. the goal is have all my project ideas here so i dont waste time writing about them in 5 different places. i can figure out the short term actions/next steps with regular review and using things3 or something
