# Tags for Actions to Take in Future

Would like to use tags for specific actions I need to take regarding a note. Maybe will make tracking tasks for a specific project easier? 


## Usage
sgs = so i can pull these up fast
Preview mode = click any label to search the tag
Check back in a few weeks to see if any of these tags can be combined for a shorter list.


## Ideas I'm testing:

#sgs-task
#sgs-read-more-on-subject
#sgs-brainstorming
#sgs-to-develop  
#sgs-to-process
#sgs-to-review
