Not sure everything about data management will fit into Nomie or if I should have a larger goal for data management. Like keeping all my data in sheets but feeding it to Nomie for making visuals. Should there ever be an issue/I leave Nomie I'll still have everything available?

- might require data cleaning, like clarifying what stuff in sheets/exports means
- have a list of places data comes from
- have a place i'm saving said data, as on massive sheet or individual sheets, whatever
- system for pasting in new data exports as needed
