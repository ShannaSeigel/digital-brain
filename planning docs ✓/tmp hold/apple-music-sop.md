# organizing my music via apple music
###### Created 202009041827 / Updated âˆž

feel like i have a pretty good grasp on how i want to handle discographies, follwing artists, etc. but maybe could make notes for future reference

also not really using the new streams playlist as much because it feels like work. made an arbitrary choice to try adding songs to my library after 2 plays but who cares? just see if i like it enough to add and can look for that artist's work in the future if i want

goals would be to clean up the discography and other folders since several are in progress
have a clear intention for different playlists/folders
group stuff together, like old pl's to hear or meditation stuff

also im not use meditations much at all after all that work. is it not easily accessible enough? not enough variety? have a million headspace things but they arent for sleep

maybe new folder for "library slices" and have a series of "no plays," "no plays + trait" or whatever i want for seeing what needs to be done within library

make folders for moods and try combining similar terms. doesnt have to be 8 terms together from music attrtibute list but maybe 2 or 3? cant anticipate every mood option or genre or whatever so i just have to accept that some songs wont be in every appropriate place with time.

added sleep audio folder playlists to sync with apple watch. maybe i can listen from there to my bluetooth headphones and not run down the battery while sleep cycles is recording.
review other sound livrary pl's to see if they fit in with sleep audio. some i think are not great for sleep
