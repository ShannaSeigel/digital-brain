# "To Experience" List Organization

###### Created Sep-18-2020 / Updated âˆž

**Sep-18-2020:** Cleaning up notes from Bear. Pretty sure I will find related notes and I do have big lists in another folder with all the related bookmarks in single markdown files for books, tv, movie, and so on.

## Previously considered approaches:

- Leisure time project in task manager
- Leave different types of bookmarks to different platforms
  - goodreads, Apple Music, etc
  - boardgame geek for physical games
    - where can i track computer and video games in one place? digital vs physical games? just a spreadsheet?
  - not sure of best bucket for items that don't fit into a platform. Probably md-files with tags in "bookmark-inspo"

### Old files:

- [TV shows 2018 - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PC8nYlS9YSjhS8BzRz1ZtvjgTR6vGopiTFzdiJ1HdyM/edit#gid=1521697829)

### more to process:

Is there a very basic format for spreadsheets like .txt? I'm thinking CSV? But that's hard to edit.

copied from sheet notes
* owned board games
* owned card games
* pc games
* console games
* Copy data from jackbox https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vBHYkPwVgdlMhrp-KsvzUzcGmxWHlCY_AdkL1n0Dtfo/edit#gid=0

i think id prefer sheets so i dont rely on 3rd party but i also like that its easy to use airtable, which reduces friction...
