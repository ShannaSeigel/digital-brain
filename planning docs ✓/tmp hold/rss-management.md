Pick "New Public Link" for RSS to Diigo
IFTTT Title:
RSS→Diigo: 
Tags: IFTTT, {feed title}, NewsFeed if news

## Will send RSS feeds to Diigo via IFTTT
- Plan to have links as a "public" link in Diigo so I can easily see a list
	- Could also just filter by the "IFTTT" tag since that's added everywhere.
- Allows me to open links to read later directly in Diigo Browser for easy highlighting and annotating on mobile
