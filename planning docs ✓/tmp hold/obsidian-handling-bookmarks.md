lots of options, not sure which will be easiest/lowest barrier for keeping future ideas

Current plan:
Use "bookmark-inspo" folder for keeping notes that aren't really actions or projects but a reminder for future use. Will try to use raindrop.io for some things but screenshots, notes about a video, stuff like that could stay here?

Well now I'm not sure because I can upload files in raindrop so I *could* bookmark stuff there instead to keep everything together.

BUT, if I stop using raindrop I can already have my bookmarks here....
I feel like raindrop is more intended for temporary info, for me at least. i dunno.

Sep-7-2020 also thinking about bookmarks in Firefox vs Raindrop.
I like raindrop, it has a nicer bookmarking interface. But Firefox has native tagging. Dunno, might stay with raindrop anyway

Goal: think about images or other media i save. Why did i save it? what spoke to me from that meme, picture, etc.? What inspired me or made me laugh?


Sep-13-2020:
still mulling over FF bookmarks vs raindrop vs putting everything in obsidian. i think id prefer everything in one place. some specific items could be outsourced, like books into goodreads, music in apple, watching into ?? reelgood?

Sep-20-2020:
onetab broke and I can't find the data. So the dozen or so groups of project tabs I saved are gone. So, let's not rely on 3rd party, at least without backups. Even that would mean not relying on Diigo but *in theory* those are temporary saves that I will eventually review and delete or annotate+delete. In practice I can save magnitudes more thoughts than process them.

remember links about:
obsidian & evergreen notes
google tutorials?
no idea..

technically this note is about stuff outside of my normal bookmark options but im not sure what those should be either. Within firefox I currently have actual, often used bookmarks in the toolbar. I have a few in the bookmark menu I never look at. the rest are in the bookmark menu under folders/loose. might just stick to that when tabs get out of control. same idea as onetab anyway.

## Avoid 3rd-Party Options, Backup Data
