# Want to put app data into Nomie
###### Created 2020-08-30 / Updated 2020-10-10

Several mentions of Nomie in T3, also a "biodata, nomie" project was made






âˆ… no project in T3 yet because no specific tasks to be done
- related to [[personal-data-management]]
- started a vault for reviewing current nomie data but stopped. have a shortcut to this in the "clean up" folder for "second brain"

## Sep-11-2020 Update
Checking out the dev version in browser and csv has been added. Haven't tried it yet but thinking of starting with fresh trackers and importing some test data. Maybe can work on this weekend but have a lot to do. Also not sure I want to make the dev option my main tracker but might see the new public release with csv soon??

## Sep-12-2020 update
Tried the dev csv import and couldn't get it working. Was following the video from Patreon with my own data but the nomie interface wasn't letting me select anything. I might have to wait for the public release regardless.

In the meantime, I'm thinking I could have a master data sheet of the stuff I want to import as kind of a backup and as a way to mark what's already been uploaded. Like could grey-out stuff once it's in Nomie and just use the sheets for making a dashboard or something outside Nomie if I'm interested.

mega database I started a while ago is here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lU9xXzEIuWjdQ9bpbbebe9GDFpjevc1F2JrIOcDilq8/edit#gid=0
Could clean it up and decide if I want to change any tracker names. Thinking of converting a lot of contexts to trackers instead. Stuff like "+feel_happy" could be a tracker of the event. Mainly places or other contexts could keep as a +context? Thinking things that could apply across a lot of trackers? Not sure. It shouldn't matter but I guess I'm thinking it'll be easier to compare trackers and contexts outside Nomie if they have a similar # name format

Kind of random right now. Dev is working on a way to import csv data. In future might be able to export data from apps and upload to Nomie on a weekly/whatever basis instead of daily, manual input. See post about first crack at this system: https://www.reddit.com/r/nomie/comments/ij5cqk/need_some_nomie_help_lets_make_a_killer_csv/ 
- exception for now being ResMed and their shitty app with no export
	- *maaaaaybe* will be fixed when I pick up data from KP soon. Not sure if it's on paper, a disk, or what


## what im picturing
a regular schedule of importing data into nomie from various sources
- would need a list of sources
- schedule/routine for when to import
- instructions for how to transform data first, if at all, to fit nomie import template(s)

## short term goal?
- to review trackers and contexts i do have. 
	- can reference "clean up>nomie" folder
	- had a bunch of data in nomie from may 2020 to july 2020 before i did a bit overhaul. would like to add that back
		- short of manually adding every note i will wait until dev provides an import feature #waiting
		- sheet i started: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lU9xXzEIuWjdQ9bpbbebe9GDFpjevc1F2JrIOcDilq8/edit#gid=0
			- need to review old tracker names to make sure they match current ones

### apple health
- Aug-30-2020 tried to export my apple health data from ios to share with dev@Nomie but it output a massive .xml file of ALL my data. saw a tutorial about putting the xml into excel to get a table. i tried adding the xml files to my free onedrive account so i could excel online but this didnt seem to work. can revist this idea later.	
	- would also consider not using apple health but this maybe is the best way to output watch data?
	- other stuff also syncs to apple health but maybe those things have their own export options

- previous goal for nomie: Track events, symptoms, medicines. Try to replace (not duplicate) Habitify/Apple Health

## data sources to consider Aug-30-2020:
- Zero fasting app
- habitify, not using now
- myAir for CPAP
- Sleep Cycles
- Cronometer
- old sheets exported from various programs
	- can delete all the old menstruation data most likely?
		- unless it has some info on OCPs if i want a record of when i took those?


## r/nomie idea for tracking progress or overall feeling of day
https://www.reddit.com/r/nomie/comments/ilqd7a/thoughts_on_working_with_daybyday_trackers/
User thinking of things like `#progress` or similar that could be used in a pick-list in the morning or individually with other notes. Could see using a similar idea.


Oct-10-2020 update

this is my primary planning file for nomie, adding notes from other files here so i can delete them

[2020-08-23 Sunday](../../!nbox/2020-08-23%20Sunday.md) has some thoughts on CRM + nomie

had a note about not tracking urination anymore. i did stop, just tracking anything notable, like odor. could be more consistent since i stopped bothering with burn feeling and such too

## sleep medicine shortcut
Would it be possible to prompt me if I'm taking trazodone when I use the sleep apps shortcut? Could pop up question like 25mg trz? And yes = new Nomie note, no = nothing

related project on data management? or too similar?
