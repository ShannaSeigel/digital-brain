# My ZK/Digital Garden shared online
###### Created 202008282222 / Updated âˆž
âˆ… no project in T3 yet, no actions planned


## current state Aug-30-2020: 
- i created a "slipbox" repository on github to turn into a website. it's fine but its a looooot of work just to get a few pages up. 
- i ran into issues with rewriting some areas that were my opinions vs facts to be more publish friendly. i think id rather not do that and overall might pause the sharing aspect.
	- one reason for sharing to a webpage was easy navigation for myself too when i want to reference my info outside obsidian. found a firefox addon to view my files in markdown and can even use links, so from the perspective i dont need to publish anything.



### Ideas/Topics to learn about:
- is it possible to password protect part of a public repo? probably not since all the files are there. was just thinking of a task list i could keep online for checking stuff off. but it wouldnt really work that that anyway
- maybe paying $8/mo for shared obsidian would solve all these issues
	- id still need to stop using wikilinks in files and should maintain the naming systems. but i could skip thinking about all the little details of hosting? no idea when its coming though. could try it for a month and see if i like it.


notes:
- cant use emjoi in file name when viewing markdown files in firefox with markdown viewer extension. consider removing this from my naming system
- could stop working on website of my files and just use a local version for references as needed? not that different from just using obsidian of course. would require dropping use of wikilinks
