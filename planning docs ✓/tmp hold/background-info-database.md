# Sheet with all my background check data for easy reference
###### Created 202008301645 / Updated âˆž
âˆ… No T3 project currently
## Goal
- Place with all my data that I might need to reference for various background checks/job related applications
	- can include old addresses
	- employers
		- contact info for supervisors or depts
	- education
	- gc license/abgc data
	- places i need to change my name
- Security for data to not be seen by others

Have considered google docs, Airtable, Notion. Currently (Aug-30-2020) using Airtable 
- airtable cv data https://airtable.com/tbln379jtHJlLTrGH/viwlcIhLfNs6saIlw?blocks=hide
- older sheet: 
	- See background spreadsheet. I know i have lots floating around for addys, etc. 
	- ðŸ”— https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xAzqgP-sNv_ppbDgBAoD6yFmoUvI-fI5xBFC_CUusik/edit#gid=0
- probably need to check if i have any data floating around elsewhere, including in Notion?

### idea for cv data
ðŸ§   Also thought about this being for CV creation, that I could have data that could auto-populate a CV template, but this might need to be a different project or sheet. 
- 2020 - Tried as a markdown file that can be updated with time
