# Integrate Tasks with Obsidian
###### Created 202008292247 / Updated ∞
∅ No project in things3

## Question: Should I replace Things3 with another option for task management?
- Why ditch Things3/Change task managers once again?
	- Because keeping all my thoughts about projects in the same place as the task list is nice. I can mostly do this in Things3 but I feel like I'm writing about projects constantly in Bear, Obsidian, even in Things3 inbox, or basically anywhere.
	- I want to avoid writing out the same ideas over and over because my project plans are not well thought out
		- I could also accomplish this by being more consistent with notes in Things3

## Plan Aug-30-2020
I have a lot of ideas here and could implement any of them. I think the easiest would be to use existing options first. Skip using the iframe, stick to projects here in obsidian and quick add tasks to things as needed.

This means my next step would be transferring projects or ideas from Things3 to here. Could leave my someday stuff there for review later?? No, just keep stuff in one place. Try not to have so many different inbox buckets that I'll have to sort later.

[[../workbench/✅ Task List]]: Review Things3 projects and move them here.

### plan thoughts/brainstorm
note: it is pretty flipping easy to add the task list link as a visual and not need to pop into any other programs. then i opened the quick add and make my task in things. easy peasy. started a task with a checklist as well for moving. not somethat really needs a note here but i could have one for brainstorming. 

how do i want to handle agendas? like "talk to kelly about X"
i have so few of these maybe it doesnt matter. could still have as a task and not something here? or have a file for "kelly-1-1-color-mtg" or some such for notes. same as in bear when id make a new note for every meeting or had one big doc for meetings with lauren

## Idea: Dynalist in iframe for outline of tasks
### Testing
Working in Obsidian iframe, there's a lot of text here to deal with in a tiny window. Same issue of just wanting the "today" type tasks for quick reference.

icloud in iframe? if i was using ios reminders? even though it sucks ass?

## Idea: Files for every task 
- Skipping all of this third-party app business and using tags/daily notes/individual notes for each task as a way to handle all of this without needing a second program.
	- People in Obsidian forum may have ideas. Some have shared workflows via programming to achieve certain things.
	- Benefit: all the tasks/content belongs to me and I don't need to worry about vendor lock-in
	- could use tags to note due dates, next status, priority, energy, time needed, waiting/call needed, etc. like actual GTD

## idea: turn [[../workbench/✅ Task List]] page into reference 
- SOP/list of tags to use
	- see above idea, classic GTD tags on context, energy, priority
	- any other tags of use
	- should those tags have any other symbol or text to separate them from content based tags? keep them at the top of the list?
		- example #@5min. adding @ after hashtag doesn't work
		- idea #-ref the dash at least works?
			- problem is tags are listed by number of references first, then alphabetical. so finding tags in larger tag list could be a pain
				- #----at-the-top lots of dashes to make it stand out
			- i dont have a ton of tags right now so its not a big deal but i wonder if this will become more of a problem over time to find tags i want
- Or even search filter ideas

## idea: rocket typist for making new pages more easily
- thought about auto-text for making links to project/task pages but I don't think it saves any time. At least not right now.
- something like `(project-)` after I put idea into `[proj name]` format
-  use `,y` from rocket typist for setting due date tags, like #2020-08-29
- if i want to add a new task file i can put all my notes about what it is in the main project page and keep the task title as a physical action step. dont care about file name being lower-case format. so it could be like `WRITE EMAIL to person about thing`
	- could do a shortcut like `,t = [[☑️todo - ]]` or however i want to label tasks
	- then jump into task page to add relevant tags for filtering
	- pin main note first or use navigation to come back
	- might need to specify folder these will live in?
- how would i handle due dates?
- QUESTION ❓ is this process any easier/harder than just typing tasks into dynalist or todoist and adding tags as needed?
	- yes i would have all of the text available on my machine for the tasks but maybe letting a dedicated manager handle all the reminders and filters would be nice?
	- though the programs might cost money for that.

## idea: keep Things3, use the quick add feature
- i can have all my notes in my project markdown file and just quick-add tasks to the inbox with all the labels and reminders i need. that would still let me filter easily. it wouldnt be that hard to make a project or a tag if i dont want things to just live in the inbox. maybe id use the someday feature too?
- or if i only have tasks related to active projects, all the someday stuff will be in obsidian
- added benefit of having repeating reminders and far off future reminders, like renewing gc licenses 2-3 yrs in future


### other notes pulled from daily notes
aug-20: even if i wanted to move things here i like all the tagging and filtering in Things3 or other programs. i maybe could cobble something together here that wouldn't require proprietary programs. could be nice in the long run. but sometimes its nice to have something polished and done. things3 has an interface i like.

maybe i can just throw my ideas in here for later review

#future-project-idea : have my own task manager that could live with knowledge management or at least be in a basic format without a tie to a specific program. would save money and save on effort of export/import of tasks into a new program if i switch something
