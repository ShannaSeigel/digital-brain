☑️ `$$` project in T3
Do any of these areas need their own project files?



From T3 projects:
## Budget
started a new budget in YNAB to account for tax deductions if i itemize. still probably not needed since we never exceed the minimum deduction but could still consider this.
[[../workbench/✅ Task List]]: finish this review/project of new catagories in budget

## Investing
started revamp of my current investment gsheet to make it easier for me to do tables. dont think ive added new investments since last review but can check.
[[../workbench/✅ Task List]] finish the sheet overhaul

looked at company supply lines previously for portfolio. have wondered about tesla, apple, amazon. could make notes in obsidian instead of adding companies to a watch list with no context. not sure i want anything to do with tesla/musk though

## Records
considering downloads of statements from various financial orgs for my records since i rarely get paper records. not sure how long different companies keep my records for download.
- statements from
	- student loans
	- banks
	- investments
	- retirement
	- credit cards
	- medical payments
	- pay stubs
	- others?
- make a routine for downloading files

questions about how to keep these records secure online, if they can safely be backed up in gdrive or icloud
- some comments i saw previously were about saving elecontric records in case of errors but backing it up somewhere physical, like a flash drive, and not to the cloud
	- could have a routine for plug in and download
- also comments to let family/spouse know where these documents are, physical or digital

## Retirement Funds
2020 did an overhaul of how investments are handled in prudential and vanguard, plan to follow with time to see if my changes were helpful. though 2020 is probably not the time to see "normal" changes.
