# Sep-7-2020 Status
## New:
- Will use the youtube app and website instead of a third party like Diigo, Raindrop, IFTTT.
- Why?
	- It's less time consuming if I don't have to add individual channels to a script every time I change something
	- The app now has filters for unwatched, continue, today, live, etc. which should allow me to find new videos more easily than in the past
	- I almost exclusively watch YouTube on the TV or queue videos on my phone. My previous plans for saving new videos to an RSS feed reader, bookmark, etc. really only works on my laptop.
- Reviewed current list of subscriptions and added older videos I missed to my Water Later list


## Future Consideration:
- Routine review of subscription list. Every few months see if there are channels I've lost interest in and remove them.
	- Could also just do this on the fly instead of a formal review


## Stopped:
- Was going to run new videos through IFTTT to Raindrop.io to keep a list of videos to watch. Including being able to find older videos I've put off and not lose them.
	- Problem:
		- Can't open videos from mobile raindrop to YT app
		- Added step of deleting from raindrop after watching video
