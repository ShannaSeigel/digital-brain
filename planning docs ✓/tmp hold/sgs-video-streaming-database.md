**general idea:** have my own database of shows im into instead of a third party

[[../workbench/✅ Task List]]: review notes and decide if anything is worth keeping for future reference


---



Idea i started working on maybe july 2020? took a bunch of notes in T3. pretty rough:

Could I build my own database and website that would let me call all of a streaming service’s offerings and then give each a level of interest, rating, or other tags? And then I could filter for what I’ve reviewed and list what meets the filter criteria? Or list things I haven’t reviewed? Would the lists come with their own metadata like genre or other descriptions.

Maybe this exists or there’s a platform to make it. I would love to imagine this as a business I could offer but I think the features people would want would come from recommendations and that’s too deep.

Also going from metadata on the show/movie entry to episode specifcs, like ReelGood, is another level. Being able to track where I’ve left off would be cool but streaming platforms can do that for me.

Getting a list of what’s coming or going would be nice.

Basically all of this exists minus the part where I can add my own tags.
https://reelgood.com/faq has a way to access their API? rather than from each service? that would be cool.
https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/wiki/index#wiki_aggregators_-_locating_shows_and_movies - info about aggregators
Tried a test page with WordPress to use ReelGood’s plugin. Requires a business plan to add plugins (really!?)
They also have a non WP option.

Example: https://www.finder.com/netflix-tv-shows#skiplist
finder-dot-com has lists for loads of streaming services along with metadata. where did they get this information?
they’re able to filter the list by year and tags, so how can i build a similar table?

Example: https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/about-us/
What’s on netflix breaks down titles by lots of categories. They say they have a team dedicated to review so some data may be from them, not from Netflix. They also mentioned the open movie API https://www.omdbapi.com/ and flix patrol https://flixpatrol.com/
flix patrol says they use TMDB, the movie database, and also you can email them about API
https://www.themoviedb.org/ they say you can have your own custom lists?? why have i never heard of this?
they also say theyve been building their database for more than 10 years and have massive amounts of data. yes please!
THEY MAKE PLEX
well fuck
https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api they also offer an API, which is free? or the db is free?
but maybe i dont even need that

made an account, can add stuff to custom lists and it’ll tell me if something is already there
would be nice if there was an option like good reads to make lists exclusive, so if an item is in one place it cant be somewhere else
https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/category/5047958519c29526b50017d6 API support forums.
The website is like other list making sites where everything is manual. I’d need to add everything I’m interested in. And maybe it would give me more control than reelgood? but also seems like it could be the same year/tag filters.
Support forum had an example of using data for their own database and that its okay with attribution. So could I do this all one-by-one just like their site but with my own tags? Not sure it’s worth it?
Or make this happen in airtable?
But for that couldnt i use reelgood to track the “where to watch” info?
API info https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction
could any of this work with google data studio? maybe it would look prettier than google sheets? plus the output might let me have a dashboard for searching?

that would be nice, to make a dashboard of everything i’m interested in, filter it, and link to description pages as desired.

maybe trying to get the data from reelgood would be better since it also tracks if something is seen and which episode is next
can it export MY data vs general data? like can i export a list from reelgood and add my tags?

just gonna step back and question if this work is worth it considering how often i just default to youtube or bullshit. but maybe itll pay off in the future when im more invested in shows/movies?

would kind of undo all the time i spent making lists lately but still, thats okay. if its a long term solution then why not?
can do a test run of just a few shows when i get to a point worth testing

going to check out TRAKT as well. i feel like it looked at it a long time ago but dunno. it can actually update watch lists based on viewing without manually making changes. i would love this. no idea how it works though, if its through laptop/mobile only or if it includes smart tv. and if it does, would it be specific profiles i wonder?
—not TV it seems

maybe i just need to use my phone or ipad as a remote and/or have a roku or something to sync with this stuff?
dunno

could i do anything by RSS? like when a new episode airs i'd get a bookmark saved? delete it when ive watched it so i know its done? how would this work for already aired stuff? probably easier on reelgood still.
- literally first search result: https://showrss.info/
	- made an IFTTT>Raindrop.io applet for 60 minutes and Star Trek Lower Decks to test sending the sub to my bookmarks
	- note, this can tell me when a new epiosde of a show airs but the link is actually to a torrent file so in theory i could download new shows if its not something i can find elsewhere.
