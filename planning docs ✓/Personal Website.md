# Shanna FYI Personal Website

## Goals
Would like a landing page for personal projects (like crafts), professional info (CV, contact), and digital notes.

## Current State
Have been playing with GitHub pages with their basic theme. Works fine. But for a digital garden I've been trying out other people's templates, like Jekyll based pages. Started looking at other static site options too.

### Static Site Research & Digital Garden
Trying to figure out something besides jekyll since it wont install on my laptop and i might want to see changes locally

tabs i was looking at:

https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll
https://chocolatey.org/packages/jekyll
https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=gatsby+vs+jekyll&atb=v234-1&ia=web

playing with simply jekyll template via netlify
