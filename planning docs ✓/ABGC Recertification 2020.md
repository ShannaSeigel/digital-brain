# ABGC Recertification 2020
Have to renew my certification for 2021-2025

## Current State
Moved all CEU data to "CEU-Tracking-Data.numbers" file. Everything has been entered into ABGC except pending units. I think there are 4 hours pending; 2 from Ambry webinars, 2 from pending Cat2 approval for journal club. **==100 hours done, 16 hours to go==**

## Next
- Listen to more webinars from ACMG or NSGC webinar series.
- [x] copied to T3?


## Waiting
- NSGC AEC schedule
	- ‚ùì What will need to be completed live for credits? Are there talks I want to complete live to ask questions?
	- Otherwise plan to carry credits over to 2021
- Future credits tab, "2021+" has some information on courses available. Eventually want to review pending courses and track anything expiring.


## Completed
- Copied everything from Airtable to Mac Numbers App so I can access data without a third party (sorta)
- Made tab in sheet for credits that can carry over to 2021 if not finished soon.
