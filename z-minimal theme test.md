# Minimal Theme
testing new theme with Minimal instead of baseline
i think i can edit the layout to remove all the dumb links on the left bar and add my socials or other navigation i'm interested in.

made a "testing theme" branch to play with this more later on

# Hamilton
Also saw this theme previously
https://github.com/ngzhio/jekyll-theme-hamilton
Thought about using it since it might get at the things i want without much effort.

has different color options

showed up with the sunset option based on time of day

could probably change fonts and such as desired, add navigation options

a lot of weird header space?

## other themes?

https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme - maybe? comes with a lot of options, probably have to run it all in command line. and can i add plugins for a graph or backlinks?

https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll for blogging looks neat

https://github.com/sharu725/hagura also nice for posts, has dark/light options

maybe useful? https://github.com/bluezio/redmine_wiki_backlinks

https://simply-jekyll.netlify.app/notes/humility-is-the-knowing-of-the-epistemic-gap - shows backlinks and related, looks pretty clean
	https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll
	
possible style to look at? https://github.com/dschapman/dschapman-com






looking through github for more templates for a graph, backlinks and im surprised how many people are using "second brain" in addition to digital garden. i thought it was just me that borrowed that from GTD (and am hoping no one thinks its a tiago forte rip off because i dislike him). makes me happy. i also love that someone described their garden as "succulent thoughts." too good.


- !! list about making knowledge graphs https://gist.github.com/mommi84/07f7c044fa18aaaa7b5133230207d8d4
- 

Inspiration sites, probably too technical for me to run myself.

- https://github.com/brettkromkamp/awesome-knowledge-management#knowledge-graphs-in-the-wild
	- just a big ass list but maybe useful

- https://github.com/kausalflow/connectome 
	- has clear sections for back links and related notes
	- example page: https://hugo-connectome.kausalflow.com/snm/single-neuron-model/
		- even has comments! so in theory it could be an interactive knowledge garden



wiki style - these feel less like a ZK and more like a list of notes. maybe they're like mocs? also some of these sites link to a github wiki and i dont want that.
- https://marvin-elsen.com/ + https://github.com/elsenm/digital-garden
	- similar look, maybe the model for marvin: https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/
- https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden
- https://www.gwern.net/index - lots of info, probably wont read it, but who knows
- https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/ - looks like they use obsidian? but no live graph?
