# Using my card catalog
- Folder "citations-apa" will be used to hold source articles and each will have a markdown note with reference/citation in APA format.
- Plan to link to the citation card when referencing it from other notes. This way I can see backlinks and easily grab the reference info if needed.
- Markdown file with reference info will link to the PDF or other file type with the source material.

Why APA? Most commonly used for my field and easy to work with.

I've been pulling citation info from [zoterobib](https://zbib.org/)

**File name experiment Nov-03-2020**
I wanted to know if I could name files "(author, year, topic)" so when I linked to a reference it would automatically show up in a useful format. Adding spaces and punctuation to the file names prevented them from being changed to HTML from markdown on GitHub. I tried adding back the dashes and replacing parentheses with the HTML symbols for them, but those were still read as regular parentheses and I was still prompted to download a markdown file rather than seeing the reference. Soooo, in-text citations will have to be edited by me to look nice if/when I need them to do so.
