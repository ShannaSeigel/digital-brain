# Using my card catalog
- Folder "citation-catalog-apa" will be used to hold source articles and each will have a markdown note with reference/citation in APA format.
- Plan to link to the citation card when referencing it from other notes. This way I can see backlinks and easily grab the reference info if needed.
- Markdown file with reference info will link to the PDF or other file type with the source material.


Why APA? Most commonly used for my field and easy to work with.

I've been pulling citation info from [zoterobib](https://zbib.org/)

Question Nov-03-2020
Could I name this files the way they would show up as an in-text citation? So if I reference the file it'll appear as "(Lewis, 2000)" in the link? My problem with this is having less information in the filename to know which reference I'm trying to use. I could have an extra descriptor but that's not standard. But also, I'm not publishing a journal article, does it matter?

test, let's reference the SPIKES paper. i'm not pointing to a PDF... because? So i'm not publically sharing an article? so its easier to see backlinks? i dont know. if im keeping the source material... i guess so i have reference info ready to go when/if needed?

[(Baile, 2000, SPIKES Protocol)]((Baile,%202000,%20SPIKES%20Protocol).md)

it does show up nicely in preview mode as (author, year, topic)
how much could this fuck up publishing? I'd have capital letters, punctuation, and spaces in the filename.

pushed changes in references folder to github, let's see what happens.

i also had to add a link to this note on my homepage. i can get to this note via markdown link just fine but the link to the baile note wants to give me a markdown file and not an html, why??
