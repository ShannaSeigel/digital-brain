# Using my card catalog
- Folder "citation-catalog-apa" will be used to hold source articles and each will have a markdown note with reference/citation in APA format.
- Plan to link to the citation card when referencing it from other notes. This way I can see backlinks and easily grab the reference info if needed.
- Markdown file with reference info will link to the PDF or other file type with the source material.


Why APA? Most commonly used for my field and easy to work with.

I've been pulling citation info from [zoterobib](https://zbib.org/)
