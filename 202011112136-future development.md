considered from lyt capstone prompt in week 0. was thinking GC ideas but that wont happen. i still want to explore these:


- PGx, learn more and think about how to present the information
- psych/patient centered counseling. 
- Motivational counseling. 

The psych topics could be more useful in short term than PGx, not sure. Could be the process of working through a course and how I pull in other material as well as my own reactions and plans. Or scripts for counseling? Not sure on that one.
