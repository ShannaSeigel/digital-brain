# Linking Your Thinking Course
Fall/Winter 2020, cohort 2 /
Designed, led by [Nick Milo](../../zk-public/-nick-milo) / 
[Linking Your Thinking Concept](linking-your-thinking)

## Getting Started
- [Note Taking vs. Note Making](note-taking-vs-note-making)
- [Why do I want to *make* notes?](shanna-as-note-maker)


## Components of Linked Notes
- [Maps of Content, Explained](map-of-content-explained)
	- [Thought Collisions](thought-collisions)




## Workshop Overview

Nick introduced himself and his journey with a digital library. He faced frustrations and likely other people drawn to the LYT course are experiencing a similar frustration with [taking notes over making notes](note-taking-vs-note-making.md)

The course moves through a series of topics with the goal of creating a foundation for a personal knowledge system that fits our individual needs. The course concludes with participants presenting a capstone project of their choosing.

### Key Takeaways (so far)

- An idea that has come up multiple times is that there isn't a perfect, one-size-fits-all program or approach to building a digital library. The core idea instead is to create relationships between ideas. By bringing ideas together,  through linking, through a [map of content](map-of-content-explained.md), a series of writing prompts, etc., we have a chance to see new ideas emerge. Through [thought collisions](thought-collisions.md), some topics may converge into a larger idea or diverge into different directions.
- The workshop is designed to focus on these core concepts first (levels of idea emergence) before moving into how to handle new information we may absorb and wish to add to our knowledge library. Nick notes that adding too much structure too soon can get in the way of thinking and that "structure needs to be earned."
- Goals include "building our note making muscles" and developing a habit of interacting with our knowledge systems.

Nov-17-2020 - session add ons
more ideas from unit 3 i want to dive into and connect:
more on what a moc is and it's flexibility. i dont think my first review captures that
more on higher order notes, i think this is the more nebulous idea for me of calling notes the same thing even though they may have different functions
	- ties into the same idea of MOCs being v flexible though
	
	
	
	

#sgs-to-develop - several places to create links in above paragraphs as those notes are created.



------------------------------------


### rough ideas for more notes:

- hx of notes
- note formats and future proofing
- future can be its own note
- failures of note taking
- failures of systems
- idea emergence its own area
- fluid framework
- relationships
- maps





↓ could change these to related notes i havent done anything with yet

## next steps
- breaking down content/ideas in my own way
- reviewing my pkm survey results and thoughts
- add notes to public pkm when ready
- search for missing notes:
