title: My Experiments with Programs

I sometimes keep a log of tests and reactions when I try a new program. This map would give me a place to pull those experiment logs together instead of a folder.

[Drafts Mac/iOS](zk-public/program-drafts)

Rough notes I haven't looked at recently:
- [notion and exist.io](../obsidian-resources/imported-images/bear-notes-with-images/notion%20and%20exist.io/notion%20and%20exist.io.md)
- [201912082318-notion-so](../experiment-logs/201912082318-notion-so.md)
- [202008291726-imdone-app-test](../experiment-logs/202008291726-imdone-app-test.md)
