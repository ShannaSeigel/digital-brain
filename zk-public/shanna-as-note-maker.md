# Why Do I Want to Make Notes?

### What am I trying to accomplish with a digital note library?

- I want to remember the things I learn and not have to "re-learn" them over and over.
- To have a place for ideas to grow and notes that can easily change as my understanding or opinions about an area changes.
- I have a lot of different interests and I want to have those ideas/interests live in one place than lots of different buckets.
- I want to explore ideas in more depth than I currently do.
	- Mostly looks like bookmarking content and maybe tagging or skimming material.


### What outcomes am I looking for, if any?

- I'd also like to think more about WHAT is in my notes rather than focusing on the structure they need, the programs I could keep fiddling with, or the other ways I can end up making more work myself or friction using my knowledge system.
- - To have a system I can trust to save and maintain my ideas externally.
	- Have to consider [future proofing](../../-box/what-is-future-proof.md) my data
