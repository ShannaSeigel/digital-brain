- Branch off from structure note for specific ideas
	- Ask how that new idea relates to other notes and make links  ❇️

[Video 2: When is a permanent note really permanent?](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/qna-2-permanent-notes/)

- You can always be wrong, so can a note ever really be done? ❇️
- Might think of durability and how likely an idea is to change with time
- The more abstract the idea, the more likely it is to change/evolve
- Notes focused on a definition, research result, etc. may be more long-lasting
	- Breaking down an idea into it's smallest facts, probably won't change much

[Video 3: Tips for good notes](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/qna-3-how-to-write-good-notes/)

	- Be inspired by the content?
