# Nick Milo

First came across user on Obsidian, shared his LYT system, "Linking Your Thinking." Probably saw on [zettelkasten-de-website](zettelkasten-de-website.md) too but didn't put it together. Has since created a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8S06HUpF9M) and workshop of the same name.

Milo like "my-low"

Professionally: Has been running a boxing/fitness program for 11 years and is working in film too.
