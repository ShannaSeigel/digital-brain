**Book Summaries FLOW: The Psychology of Optimal Experience**

*NOTE: turns out I have this ebook already, should probably just read it.*


Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, 1990. [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=Bi4Tm0s8Lp&rank=1)

Book mentioned a lot by Nick, or at least the concept of Flow. On my to-read list but decided to get some summaries for a quick intro / reference for when the topic comes up.

[Four Minute Books](https://fourminutebooks.com/flow-summary/)

> **1-Sentence-Summary:** *[Flow](https://amzn.to/2Cy0mrL) explains why we seek happiness in externals and what’s wrong with it, where you can really find enjoyment in life, and how you can truly  become happy by creating your own meaning of life.*

Sounds like the focus here is to seek validation and motivation from my internal goals and desires rather than validation from others or objects.

Key goal: reach a "state of effortless work"

- Challenges and skills work together and time flies by rather than feeling bogged down

Summary's 3 Lessons

1. Pleasure and enjoyment are two different things
   - Pleasure comes from sensory experiences, like eating, sex, etc. and takes over the control of your attention. People conflate this with happiness.
   - Enjoyment comes from focusing, you control your attention.
     - This is considered real happiness
     - By working toward your goals, choosing what you are doing, you increase enjoyment
       - This is where you bring in FLOW
   - Most current-day activities focus on instant gratification, which is not sustainable happiness and we all feel kind of miserable and hate social media.

2. Flow is the state when challenges and skills match so time flies by
   - The state when you are so immersed in what you are doing that you forget about worries/stress and wonder where the time went.
   - Trigger flow in 2 ways:
     - Pick an activity that you find rewarding and meaningful, that has no external incentive 
       - example, doing something for money or noteriety vs planting a tree, drawing a picture, reading, whatever carries meaning for me.
       - Basically just what I think is awesome to do.
     - Make sure the challenge matches your current skills
       - Makes sense, otherwise I'd be overwhelmed and frustrated.
       - Also don't want to be bored. Looking for a middle ground of just enough challenge, just slightly beyond comfort zone
3. Life goals are meaningless, set your life goals
   - I create my own meaning in life
   - Set an ultimate life goal
     - What would that even look like? Its not like I know ALL my options.
   - The goal itself doesn't matter, what matters is it keeps you motivated to do something you enjoy and feel engaged with.

Additional summary:

https://theartofliving.com/flow-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/

> Happiness isn’t pleasure. Happiness is **flow**: a state of optimal  experience; a state of joy, creativity and total involvement in which  problems seem to disappear and there is an exhilarating feeling of  self-transcendence and control.

> But flow isn’t just something that happens to us, *it’s something we can engineer*. Something we can get better and better at, no matter what we’re doing, who we’re with or what life throws our way.

To find the sweet spot between boredom and anxiety you need a few things:

- Clearly defined goals
- Ways to measure progress
- Keep practicing how to concentrate fully on the task at hand
- Keep developing skills
- Keep raising the stakes, step further and further from comfort zone
