# Note Taking vs Note Making

The *note taker* vs the *note maker.* The note taker may be highlighting or summarizing someone else's work while the note maker spends time developing or engaging with their own notes of ideas and options.

### My failures in note taking

After years of jotting down notes, I have a cluttered mess of files that is overwhelming to think about, let alone organize. For me, I often save multiple pages about the same topic to review later with the goal of learning something. But that creates a burden of 20 more things to read before getting to my own ideas. Plus it takes me so long (months to years) to come back to some bookmarks that it's an outdated waste of space. Most anything I'm trying to learn I can search for online. 

### I want to stop cataloging someone else's ideas

I certainly identify with the idea being discussed in the [LYT workshop](../../zk-public/-lyt-workshop-map.md) that most of my notes are full of someone else's content and/or out-of-date tasks.

Instead of collecting lots of new ideas in a pile where I haven't actually learned anything, I can focus on developing the knowledge I already have, in my own words. Creating quality over quantity.
