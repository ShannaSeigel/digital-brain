# Linking Your Thinking

[LYT Website](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/) | LYT pronounced "Light"

Method that builds on the zettelkasten framework and emphasizes links between concepts and notes in order to drive idea collisions. By creating links between ideas and maps of content to pull those ideas together, you can speed up the process of idea emergence, convergence, or divergence.
