title: Trusting My Systems

i have notes about this, from zk-de and elsewhere about *using* systems over playing with them and trusting them, such as in GTD. 

#sgs-to-develop 

thinking about this in [shanna-as-note-maker](zk-public/shanna-as-note-maker.md)
could relate to [note-taking-vs-note-making](zk-public/note-taking-vs-note-making.md) in terms of doing rather than collecting

at some point i could also review my old notes about [20190924212218 Problem and Solution: Collector's Fallacy](20190924212218%20Problem%20and%20Solution:%20Collector's%20Fallacy)
