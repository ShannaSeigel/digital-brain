Have the ebook, looked at some summaries for a quick intro [book-cliffnotes-flow](book-cliffnotes-flow.md)

Flow is broken down into 10 chapters.

My goal isn't to replicate the book, I have the book for that. **MY GOAL IS TO THINK ABOUT MY REACTIONS, WRITE DOWN KEY IDEAS, AND MAKE CONNECTIONS**

*Talk about trial by fire Ms. "What do I do with literature notes?"*



## Preface

Author is summarizing decades of work for members of the public.  

> “positive aspects of human experience—joy, creativity, the process of total involvement with life I call flow”
>
> Excerpt From: Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. “Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.” Apple Books. 

Not a book full of insider tips on happiness. *Thank goodness because I'm kind of sick of those.* The goal is to present general principles. Like a recipe or pattern, gives the basic blocks and I can build from there.

> “...transform boring and meaningless lives into ones full of enjoyment. There is no promise of easy short-cuts in these pages. But for readers who care about such things, there should be enough information to make possible the transition from theory to practice.”

I'm down for the challenge!
