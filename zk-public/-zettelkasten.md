*Also referred to in my notes as "ZK"*

### What is it? How do I use it?

First learned about zettelkasten from [www.zettelkasten.de](https://zettelkasten.de/) while searching for better ways to organize my ideas and projects. See notes about the website: [zettelkasten-de-website](zettelkasten-de-website.md)
