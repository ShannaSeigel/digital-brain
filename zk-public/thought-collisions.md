# Thought Collisions

New ideas can form from other thoughts coming together and creating relationships.

In terms of idea emergence, some ideas may converge, some may diverge, some may lead to the emergence of a new idea. Two opposing ideas may both be relevant or one idea may be redundant or out of date and can be discarded.

Bringing ideas together (like in a [map of content](zk-public/map-of-content-explained)) to examine these relationships can be a thought collision.


@KillerWhale on LYT Forum:
Discussed the similarity to conflict in storytelling. A character has a complication at odds with their will, creating conflict. The story comes from "that friction between will and complication." **In our brains we can bring thoughts together and look for links between them. Those links can tell us a story about how we view the world.**
