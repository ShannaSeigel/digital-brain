<small>← [LYT Workshop MOC](zk-public/-lyt-workshop-map.md)</small>

What is a "map of content" or MOC? In [linking-your-thinking](zk-public/linking-your-thinking.md) terms, this is a space to bring ideas together. Initially I thought of these types of notes as an index or outline of atomic notes that contribute to a larger topic. 

I think of a MOC like a sandbox or lab bench, wherever I can test out ideas without much consequence if I change my mind about something.

> MOC: A note that mainly has links to other notes, thus "mapping" the contents of multiple notes in your digital library. MOCs help you gather, develop, and navigate your ideas. – [LYT Glossary](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/LYT+Glossary)

***The goal of this workspace is to bring ideas together and consider their relationships to one another. ***

Nick refers to pitting ideas against one another in a MOC as "[thought collisions](thought-collisions)" By pulling ideas into a single space one can help accelerate thought collisions.
