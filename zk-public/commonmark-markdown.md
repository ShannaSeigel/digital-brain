### What is CommonMark and why use it?

- Original [markdown](../zk-public/-markdown) was not perfect, created bugs, and hasn’t been updated since 2004 (source: https://commonmark.org)
- Over the following decade people came up with many iterations of markdown
	- leads to documents that render differently in one system vs another, like [GitHub](../zk-public/github-flavored-markdown) vs [Pandoc](../zk-public/program-pandoc)
	- No standard test reference
		- [mdTest](../zk-public/program-mdtest) can provide testing of .md implementations
		-  [Babelmark](../zk-public/program-babelmark-for-markdown) can compare output of 20+ flavors of .md and see if there’s a consensus result.

CommonMark aims to have a

> <ins>standard, unambiguous syntax specification for Markdown</ins>, along with a <ins>suite of comprehensive tests</ins> to validate Markdown implementations against this specification.

Several implementations of CommonMark exist, including:
- GitHub/GitLab
- Reddit
- Stack Overflow
