# Drafts by Agile Tortoise
[Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) creates blank space for notes on MacOS/iOS devices. Can push notes to other programs/services as needed or archive notes to keep.


### Resources
- See [Drafts user guide](https://docs.getdrafts.com/)
- `⌘e` to bring up Markdown preview window
- `⌘.` to swap to/from "link mode." (makes links clickable)

## Drafts Usage
*Nov-16-2020 - Thoughts on how I'll use program*

### Highlights
- So far I'm pretty impressed with this program. I downloaded it on my phone once in the past but never got that far. I guess because it seemed like there was paid stuff.
- It has a lot more it can do than Pretext, most obvious being font choices and sharing links directly to Drafts instead of c/p to Pretext. Well, I guess I was saving stuff to my "-box" folder in iCloud before. We'll see how I like this and if I use one more than the other.
- Can batch edit drafts


### Issues
- I'm not sure if I would use this to replace Typora on laptop. I CAN see a markdown preview here but these drafts aren't actually markdown files yet. So that feels iffy. Plus there are a variety of theme options for Typora that make using the app fun.
- If I decide to export text to a markdown file and open it on my laptop in Obsidian or Typora I can't go back and edit it from Drafts on mobile. The "draft" no longer exists. I'd still need a way to edit those files, maybe from Pretext(?) IF I even want to edit on mobile. I usually don't.
- NOTE: tags on drafts are attached to the draft file, they aren't in the text and won't carry over if text is exported out of program


### Possible Uses
- Saving posts I like from web outside my digital library (bookmarks)
	- Pro:
	  - This declutters my Obsidian vault
	  - Can still add tags in Drafts for what stuff is related to without a bunch of tags in Obsidian that aren't used for knowledge system specifically
	- Con:
		- This defeats the purpose of keeping all my thoughts and files in one place
		- I'm concerned about dataloss since individual drafts aren't automatically individual text/markdown files I can backup


### Fonts in Drafts
The whole reason I looked at Drafts was because Pretext only allows a monospace font and I saw a discussion about comic sans being so riddiculous that it could be useful when brainstorming. It's not an intimidating font. I'm not sure if this is true but I wanted to mess with the idea.

[Instructions for installing new fonts on phone](https://www.howtogeek.com/350438/how-to-install-fonts-on-an-ipad-or-iphone/). Used app iFont to install and downloaded the font files from my iCloud folder. 

#### MacOS Trials
- Switched font to "Lexie Reader," which has a similar feel to CS but is intended to be dyslexia friendly (post about Comic Sans for writing also brought up its use for dyslexia, which appears to have mixed evidence).
- Hiragino Sans 18pt also nice

#### iPhone Trials
- Hiragino Maru Gothic pro. looks nice. Not so comic. Size 18 nice and clear.
- Chalkboard SE is the closest to CS on phone. 
- Do fonts save per draft? 
	- Nope. App wide change on phone, all notes will appear in chosen font
	- Same for MacBook
	- iPhone and MacBook can display different fonts for the program though.

#### Impressions
- Writing in comic sans looks like email from my parents. Not super motivating.
- I wonder if the font even matters? Maybe we get used to seeing certain fonts as the default in writing that switching to CS or pretty much anything can be enough a shift to keep the process interesting?
