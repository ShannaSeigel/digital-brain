# Don't worry about "permanent" notes, just useful notes

[Blog post](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/literature-notes-vs-permanent-notes/) on [zettelkasten-de-website](../slipbox/zettelkasten-de-website) from forum discussion

**Question:** User asking about the idea of a "permanent" note, like a note that is final/perfect/never-to-be-changed.

**Answer:** Another user replied that notes should be useful to you, the person developing their zettelkasten, but <ins>notes will always be changeable and impermanent they can and will change over time.</ins>

Advice:

- Resist our human urge to label and box up every idea/thing.
- Just go ahead and capture everything in your zettelkasten system and plan to review and modify notes over time.

> The goal is to have notes that help and speak to you now and, more importantly, in the future... Be Bayesian and modify your ideas as new evidence presents itself.
