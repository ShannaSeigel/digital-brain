# My Slipbox Repository
Through GitHub Pages I'm testing out the idea of my own online knowledge repository.

*Update Nov-2020*<br>I'm attending the [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/) workshop and would like to compare hosting my notes through [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I'm working out the details but they should end up with the same content available. 


### How did I get here?
I started learning about personal knowledge management a few years ago and I've thought about an online version of my knowledge files for a while. Once I saw people sharing their digital gardens I thought I'd join in on the fun! Hopefully sharing my experience can help others with their knowledge sharing journey. Especially non-programmers and/or people new to knowledge systems (translation: I don't totally know what I'm doing but I'm trying anyway).

I jumped on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) train in Spring 2020 but I've used plenty of other programs in the past. I had been using [Bear](https://bear.app/) for several years since it's very easy to work with and I could export any of my notes as text or markdown files. Ideally I want my documents to be independent of any specific software though so I'm transitioning completely to markdown.
