For future shanna.fyi landing page that includes professional information as well as my notes or other projects

would like to make it pretty in future but for now i might settle for two columns, specifically a responsive layout to view on desktop or mobile

some links:
https://learnwebtutorials.com/responsive-two-column-layout-using-box-sizing
https://reactgo.com/two-column-responsive-layout/
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_two_columns.asp

thinking professional, like CV, on the left so it'll be on top for mobile
right can have notes, maybe projects beneath? professional would span two right side columns? could have blog below that??

not sure how much to pack in or if there's stuff to put in a menu/header


i wouldnt mind also figuring out a light and dark mode for the site. at least for notes??
