# Digital Brain Lvl5 👩🏻
*<small>(AKA: my Home Note)</small>*

<ins>My personal knowledge system goal:</ins> to stop curating a pile of meaningless notes and to stop creating more work for myself. I want to be thinking and doing, not wasting time.
<br>

### Maps of Content (MOCs)
My first experiment with a map of content was while I learned how to use Markdown (and Obsidian). Thanks to [Nick-Milo](zk-public/-nick-milo.md) and the folks at [zettelkasten-de](zk-public/zettelkasten-de-website.md) for first introducing the idea of structure notes or maps for my digital notes.

A few tags under review for usefulness
- #sgs-needs-notes 
- #sgs-to-process 
- #sgs-to-develop 
- #sgs-to-review 
- #sgs-read-more-on-subject 
- #sgs-brainstorming 


<br>

### Brainstorming
Not sure if I want to default format all my notes with frontmatter to save on adding it later if I do publish. For the moment leaning toward not bothering since I may never take that step and/or I might have to edit it all again since I don't know much about this. Can revisit this in future
